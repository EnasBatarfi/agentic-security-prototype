1. Policy/Authorization Layer/Types
Typed authorization objects for the policy layer.

This module defines the standard authorization request shape used by
the application-level policy engine.

The model follows the common PARC structure:

    Principal + Action + Resource + Context -> Decision

Definitions:
- Principal: the actor, usually Django request.user
- Action: the business action, such as file:read or file:delete
- Resource: the protected object, such as a file or account - the object being accessed by the action
- Context: the environment, such as file chat or profile chat
